# 🚨 SOLUTION: Restart Your Backend Server

## The Problem:

Your backend server is using **cached Firebase credentials** from the old project `cartuno-a6af3`.

Error message:
```
Firebase ID token has incorrect "aud" (audience) claim. 
Expected "cartuno-a6af3" but got "learningsaint-971bd"
```

## Why This Happened:

When you started your backend server, it loaded Firebase Admin SDK with old credentials. Even though you've updated the files, **Node.js caches the initialization** and won't reload until you restart the server.

## ✅ The Fix (30 seconds):

### **RESTART YOUR BACKEND SERVER**

1. **Stop the current backend server:**
   - Find the terminal running your backend
   - Press `Ctrl + C` to stop it

2. **Start it again:**
   ```bash
   cd cartunoBackend
   npm start
   # or
   node server.js
   # or whatever command you use
   ```

3. **Done!** ✅

## 🧪 Verify It's Fixed:

After restarting, you should see in the backend startup logs:

```
✅ Connected to MongoDB
✅ Firebase Admin initialized (or similar message)
Server running on port 5000
```

Now try logging in from your frontend again - it should work!

## 📋 What to Expect:

### Before Restart (ERROR):
```
Backend expects: cartuno-a6af3
Frontend sends:  learningsaint-971bd
Result: ❌ Token verification fails
```

### After Restart (SUCCESS):
```
Backend expects: learningsaint-971bd ✅
Frontend sends:  learningsaint-971bd ✅
Result: ✅ Token verification succeeds
```

## 🔍 Current Configuration (Verified Correct):

### ✅ serviceAccountKey.json:
```json
{
  "project_id": "learningsaint-971bd" ✅
}
```

### ✅ .env:
```env
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=learningsaint-971bd ✅
```

### ✅ Frontend config:
```javascript
projectId: "learningsaint-971bd" ✅
```

**Everything is correct! Just restart the backend server.**

## 🚀 Quick Commands:

### If using npm start:
```bash
# Stop: Ctrl + C in the terminal
# Start:
cd cartunoBackend
npm start
```

### If using nodemon:
```bash
# Nodemon should auto-restart, but if not:
cd cartunoBackend
npm run dev
```

### If using PM2:
```bash
pm2 restart all
```

## ✅ After Restart - Test the Flow:

1. **Refresh your frontend** (F5)
2. **Try phone login again**
3. **Enter phone number** and click Send OTP
4. **Should work now!** ✅

You should see:
```
Frontend: ✅ OTP sent successfully
Backend:  ✅ Token verified successfully
Result:   ✅ User logged in
```

---

## 🎯 Root Cause Explained:

Firebase Admin SDK initializes once when the Node.js server starts:

```javascript
// This runs ONCE when server starts
const admin = require('firebase-admin');
admin.initializeApp({
  credential: admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount)
});
```

Even if you change `serviceAccountKey.json`, the server won't re-read it until you restart.

**Solution: Always restart backend when changing Firebase credentials!**

---

## 🎉 Summary:

1. Your credentials are **100% correct** ✅
2. Frontend and backend files **match perfectly** ✅
3. The server just needs to **reload the new credentials** ✅

**→ Restart backend server → Problem solved!** 🚀
